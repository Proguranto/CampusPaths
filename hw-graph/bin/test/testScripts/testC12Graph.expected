# Tests graph creation/viewing with an cyclic
# graph with 1 node and 2 edges.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add a pair of edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1) n1(e2)

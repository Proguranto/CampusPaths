# Tests graph creation/viewing with an acyclic
# graph with 2 nodes and 0 edges

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1 and n2
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are:
the children of n2 in graph1 are:

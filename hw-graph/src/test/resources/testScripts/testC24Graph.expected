# Tests graph creation/viewing with a cyclic
# graph with 2 nodes and 4 edges.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add 4 edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1
added edge e3 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e4 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1 and n2
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1), n2(e3)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(e2), n1(e4)

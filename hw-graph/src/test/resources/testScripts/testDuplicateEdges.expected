# Test what happens when adding two of the same edges
# to a simple graph with 1 node.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add two of the same edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1)

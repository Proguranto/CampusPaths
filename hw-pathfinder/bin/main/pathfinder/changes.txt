Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

First, I changed the Node and Edge inner class to generic classes as I want their labels to
not be specific only to Strings, but other types as well to represent other things.
Additionally, this means my Graph class needs to be a generic class as I needed to add types
as I used Node and Edge types in my Graph, thus they require type parameters which would be
the type parameters for Graph.

^Making Node, Edge, and Graph generic means that I had to change return types of methods and
types of fields.

Second, I made my Node and Edge classes static inner classes because I want the client to be able to
create nodes and edges without constructing a Graph instance. Additionally, it would be nice for
the client to create different nodes and edges of different types, without it being restricted
to the Graphs type that is used to create them.

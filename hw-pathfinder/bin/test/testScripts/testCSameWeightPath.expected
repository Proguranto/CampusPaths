# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the graph is cyclic and there are multiple paths
# from start to dest node with same edge weights.

created graph graph7

added node S to graph7
added node 1 to graph7
added node 2 to graph7
added node D to graph7

added edge 0.000 from S to 1 in graph7
added edge 0.000 from 1 to 2 in graph7
added edge 0.000 from 2 to S in graph7
added edge 1.000 from S to D in graph7

path from S to D:
S to D with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000

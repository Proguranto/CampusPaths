# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the graph is acyclic and there are multiple paths
# from start to dest node with same edge weights.

created graph graph6

added node S to graph6
added node 1 to graph6
added node 2 to graph6
added node D to graph6

added edge 1.000 from S to 1 in graph6
added edge 1.000 from S to 2 in graph6
added edge 1.000 from 1 to D in graph6
added edge 1.000 from 2 to D in graph6

path from S to D:
S to 1 with weight 1.000
1 to D with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000

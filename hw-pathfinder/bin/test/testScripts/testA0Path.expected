# from start to dest node.

created graph graph1

added node S to graph1
added node 1 to graph1
added node 2 to graph1
added node 3 to graph1
added node D to graph1

added edge 1.000 from S to 1 in graph1
added edge 1.000 from S to 2 in graph1
added edge 2.500 from 1 to 3 in graph1
added edge 2.000 from 2 to 3 in graph1

path from S to D:
no path found

# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the graph is cyclic and there is no path
# from start to dest node.

created graph graph2

added node S to graph2
added node 1 to graph2
added node 2 to graph2
added node D to graph2

added edge 1.000 from S to 1 in graph2
added edge 1.000 from 1 to 2 in graph2
added edge 1.000 from 2 to S in graph2

path from S to D:
no path found

# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the graph is acyclic and there is 1 path
# from start to dest node.

created graph graph3

added node S to graph3
added node 1 to graph3
added node 2 to graph3
added node D to graph3

added edge 1.000 from S to 1 in graph3
added edge 2.000 from 1 to 2 in graph3
added edge 0.500 from 2 to D in graph3

path from S to D:
S to 1 with weight 1.000
1 to 2 with weight 2.000
2 to D with weight 0.500
total cost: 3.500

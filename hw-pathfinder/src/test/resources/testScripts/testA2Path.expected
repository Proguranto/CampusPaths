# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the graph is acyclic and there is 2 paths
# from start to dest node.

created graph graph4

added node S to graph4
added node 1 to graph4
added node 2 to graph4
added node 3 to graph4
added node D to graph4

added edge 1.000 from S to 1 in graph4
added edge 4.000 from S to 2 in graph4
added edge 1.000 from 1 to 3 in graph4
added edge 3.142 from 3 to D in graph4
added edge 5.000 from 2 to D in graph4

path from S to D:
S to 1 with weight 1.000
1 to 3 with weight 1.000
3 to D with weight 3.142
total cost: 5.142

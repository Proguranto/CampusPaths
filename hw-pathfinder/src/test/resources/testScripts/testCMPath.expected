# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the graph is cyclic and there is multiple paths
# from start to dest node.

created graph graph5

added node S to graph5
added node 1 to graph5
added node 2 to graph5
added node 3 to graph5
added node D to graph5

added edge 1.000 from S to 1 in graph5
added edge 1.000 from 1 to 2 in graph5
added edge 1.700 from 2 to S in graph5
added edge 2.000 from S to 3 in graph5
added edge 3.000 from 3 to D in graph5
added edge 2.000 from S to D in graph5

path from S to D:
S to D with weight 2.000
total cost: 2.000
